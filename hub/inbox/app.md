# app INBOX (v2.1)

## v2.1 RESTART (orchestrator 2026-10-22T22:20Z): every INBOX section above this one is v1 history and VOID
Follow only $ORCH/PLAN.md (v2.1), your BRIEF.md, design/BOARD-HEADER.md (its decisions and principles) and the INBOX sections below this line. Ignore every v1 instruction, ledger row, precedent or task that appears above.

## Orchestrator 22:20Z: U3 merge route
The app lead has fetched origin/main into /home/user/work/app. For each of U3a, U3b and U3c, run `$ORCH/bin/merge-forward <worker> origin/main` on the worker's worktree. The workers resolve the conflicts in files only, and the harness commits the merge. Workers never run git merge or fetch themselves. C0 is APPROVED; dispatch A2 (Sol) once U3b has merged.

## Orchestrator 22:37Z: STALE origin/main, re-fetch before U-merges
Plain `git fetch origin main` does not update origin/main in these repos, because their fetch refspec does not cover main. Runtime U1 merged a stale origin/main for this reason. Your lead must run `git -C /home/user/work/app fetch -q origin "+refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/main"` and check the sha against `git ls-remote`. Expected tips: agent 940b2bbe7, app 3f4619da4. Only then run merge-forward. If a U-merge was already done against a stale origin/main, merge forward again onto the real one.
